# Ising Model
is a a mathematical model of statistical physics designed to describe the magnetization of a material. This one realized with **C# WPF**.
## This programm
uses the Metropolis method to flip lattice spins depending on temperature.

## The data
on the obtained lattice at each step are saved to a file, and its energy and magnetization are calculated from the configuration.
